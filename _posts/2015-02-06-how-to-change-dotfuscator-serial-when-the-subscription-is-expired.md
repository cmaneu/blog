Right now, PreEmptive Dotfuscator Pro is the only obfuscation software that works with Windows Phone, Windows Store and universal apps. So, I use it from time to time.

Today, my license expired. As an MVP, I have the chance to be able to renew my license. However, changing it within an existing Dotfuscator install is not straightforward.

You need to delete all the contents of the `C:\ProgramData\PreEmptive Solutions\Dotfuscator Professional Edition` folder, and then, relaunch DotFuscator.
