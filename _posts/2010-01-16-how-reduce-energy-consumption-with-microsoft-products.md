<p>Nowadays, everyone can do something for the environment. This week Chris (another MSP) say <a href="http://www.chris-alexander.co.uk/2057">some words about Microsoft Hohm,</a> and Hitcher teach you how to “eco drive” <a href="http://www.msstudentlounge.com/tabid/60/default.aspx?id=784">with Microsoft Auto</a>. Did you know that <em>at least </em>two new functionalities built in Windows Server R2 that will help you to protect the earth…one server at a time ?</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <h2>Core parking</h2>  <p>A lot of desktop computers and almost all server computers runs on multi-core processors. This is a huge power for our apps and servers or for virtualization. But, do you need all of them all the time ? Core parking is a new improvement in Windows Server 2008 R2 (and Windows 7) that allows the OS to “park” unused cores and so reduce energy consumption.<a href="http://blog.christophermaneu.fr/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/image.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://blog.christophermaneu.fr/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/image_thumb.png" width="380" height="369" /></a>&#160;</p>  <h2>P-State adjustment</h2>  <p>There is another way to reduce energy consupmtion at the processor level. You may already know that in all almost laptops, the speed of your processor is adjusted whenever your are plugged in or not. With P-State, your desktop/server computer can to this trick too !
