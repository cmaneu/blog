I came across a great document about .net performance.

[Essential Performance Facts and .NET Framework Tips](http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download?ProjectName=roslyn&DownloadId=838017) is written by Bill C., who was a PM on [Roslyn Team](http://roslyn.codeplex.com).

In 14 pages, you've got basic .net performances core issues (ie. they applies to any .net app, from mobile to datacenter), and span across different themes, notably allocations in:

- boxing,
- strings manipulation,
- async code,
- LINQ and lambdas.
